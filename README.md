# Medical-Shop Data Manager

Project made using python language which stores the data of medicines available and its amount.

It accepts orders from the customer and binary search tree is used to search the given medicine data. The generated bill is displayed on console as well as sent to the customers through mails with an option to pay right now or later.

By using Binary Search tree, the searching process becomes less time consuming hence efficiency of code increases. Also used pandas Dataframes to store the medicine data imported from CSV and for bill generation after the order has been confirmed.
